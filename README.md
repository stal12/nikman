# Nikman

![example_image](other/example_game.png)

Nikman is a 2D maze game for PC that you can play with a friend (or a foe), done with C++ and OpenGL.

The design is inspired by Amazin' SPISPOPD, a classic indie game by Hamumu Software.

## How to play

Move with arrows or WASD.
Eat the pizza crusts.
Avoid evil jemels.

## Installation

### Windows (installer)

The easiest way to install Nikman under windows is to download the installer from [itch.io](https://itch.io), here: <https://stal12.itch.io/nikman>.

### Linux, Windows (from source)

Alternatively, you can build Nikman from source.

You need:

- [CMake](https://cmake.org/) 3.17.1 or higher
- A C++ compiler supporting C++17
- [GLFW](https://www.glfw.org/), to create the window and receive inputs
- [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/) (audio module only), for sounds and music
- A graphic processor driver implementing OpenGL 3.3 or higher

Other 3rd party software already included in the repository:

- [Glad](https://glad.dav1d.de/)
- [stb_image](https://github.com/nothings/stb)

#### Instructions

1) Clone the repo.
2) Run CMake, choose the `build` directory, configure, generate.
3) Compile.
4) Run Nikman.

**Only for Windows:** if you want to build the installer, follow the instructions in the [tutorial](./docs/installer/CreateWindowsInstaller.md).

## Customization

### Levels

You can add custom levels in the game, by editing files in the `resources/levels` directory, in the source or directly in the installation folder.

If you installed the game in the default path, you may face problems of missing write permission; fear not, and show your computer who's in charge here!

For those who master Italian, the instructions for levels editing are detailed in `other/libellids/istruzioni.txt`. The others can just learn from the examples, it is a fairly easy format.

For convenience, the script `other/libellids/init_maze.py` initializes an empty level of the chosen size.

For instance, this is the first level:

```text

+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

Just replace the files in the `resources` folder with your own.
